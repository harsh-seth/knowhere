### About me

I'm Harsh Seth and I'm a CS grad currently working towards my Master of Science in Computer Science degree from UMass Amherst

I'm passionate about Augmented Reality and applications of Deep Learning and NLP in primarily Vision based contexts - Scene Understanding, 3D Scene Reconstruction, Prompt based Scene Synthesis, Multimodal AI for Scene Synthesis

In addition to that, I am always on the lookout of new ideas and methods, as well as trying my hand on finding better (*faster/more streamlined/easier/cheaper/more robust/enhanced*) solutions to open problems which can help improve the lives of people across the board - be it researchers, developers, businesses or the public at large

You can view a small snapshot of my experiences in my [resume](../docs/Harsh%20Seth%20resume.pdf)
