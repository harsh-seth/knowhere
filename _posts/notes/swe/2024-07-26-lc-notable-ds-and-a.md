## Fundamental Data Structures
- Object
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Hash Maps
- Stacks
- Queues
- Priority Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- (Binary) Heaps

> NOTE: It is possible to build all of these data structures from the first two in the list
> - Arrays -> Stacks, Queues
> - Objects -> Linked Lists -> Stacks, Queues
> - Objects, Arrays -> Hash Maps
> - Objects -> Trees, Graphs
> - Trees -> Heap -> Priority Queue

Each data structure should allow for the following operations: `Access`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Sort` (if applicable)


## Notable Algorithms
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Knapsack Problem
- Dijistra's Algorithm
- A* Search
