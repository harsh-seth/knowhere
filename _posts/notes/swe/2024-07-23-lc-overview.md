This series of posts documents the learnings, challenges i encountered and the decisions i made on my journey to hone the (algorithmic) tools of my trade. It's partly a tool for me to arrange my thoughts on this, partly a resource for me to revisit every now and then, and partly to serve as a guide for anyone who might find it useful. <br/><br/> For any Hiring Managers/TA Partners seeing this, drop me an [email](mailto: harshseth2006@gmail.com) if you like what you see!
