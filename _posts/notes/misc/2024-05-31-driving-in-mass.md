*It goes without saying, but this page should not be solely relied upon for legal or safety advice. It is, at best, an opinionated summarization of the actual texts. Assume the contents here to be inaccurate. Please refer to the drivers manual and other properly authorized documents for up-to-date, accurate information.*

### Notes
#### Safety
**General**
- Drive Defensively. Assume the worst of conditions and worst of behaviors
- Follow the 3 Second Rule when keeping distance between other vehicles
    - Extend duration to 4 seconds for motorcycles and heavy load vehicles
- Do not cut in immediately front of heavy load vehicles, as they may not have enough time to react
- Do not ride your brakes (rest your foot on the brake lever)
- Avoid driving between 12 midnight and 6 am

**Health**
- Motorists must have 20/40 vision in their good eye, and 120Â° of peripheral vision
    - Motorists with 20/50 - 20/70 vision can only drive in daylight

**Violations (but also good advice)**
- Every passenger in a passenger vehicle needs to wear a seat belt
    - The passenger and the drivers stand to be fined if not, however the violation can only be awarded if stopped for other traffic violations
- The side and rear windows of a vehicle can be tinted upto 35%, but the windscreen must be untinted.
- Motorist must shift from high beam to low beam when within 500ft of an oncoming vehicle or closer than 200ft when behind a vehicle.
- Turn on headlights and taillights when using windshield wipers
- Do not honk at or wave through pedestrians when they are crossing roads
- Do not pass stopped vehicles at road crossings
- The driver side window must be able to move up and down
- Child restraints/seats must have a sticker indicating that the design was approved by the DOT affixed on it
- Wheels treads must be at least 2/32 inches deep
    - Easy test: The distance between the edge of a penny and the top of Lincoln's head is approx 2/32. Insert a coin into a tyre groove, if the top of Lincoln's head is visible, the treads are too shallow.
- Let motorcyclists and bicyclists pass through intersections first when turning left
- Do not pass a motorcyclist or bicyclist if intending to turn right immediately after

**Cold/Wet Weather Conditions**
- Dry wet brakes by lightly applying them to restore their efficiency
- If travelling too fast and potentially hydroplaning on wet surfaces, slow down naturally. DO NOT apply your brakes as it may cause the car to skid and flip
- If skidding, turn into the direction of skidding to regain control
- Keep fuel tanks at at least 50% capacity to prevent the fuelline from freezing

**Sharing the road with Vulnerable Road Users**
- Vulnerable Road Users (bicyclists, pedestrians) have full access to all of the states' roads
    - Exceptions: Interstate Highways, Express Ways, Roads where otherwise mentioned
- Give 4ft. of passing distance to all such Vulnerable Road Users
    - It is permissible (if safe to do so) to cross into the other lane, rumble strips or even the center lines
- When the "Motorists must give 4 feet to pass" is present, it is an indication that there is no dedicated bike lane in that stretch
- Do not share lanes with motorcyclists, even if they only occupy the right edge of their lane
- Be careful when opening doors as you may hit passing bicyclists and motorcyclists.
- Do not honk at or wave through pedestrians when they are crossing roads

**Child Restraints/Seats**
- Child restraints/seats must be installed in the back seat if the front seats has an airbag installed
- The best place to install a child seat in back, with the back middle seat being the safest.
- Seats for infants should face towards the back of the vehicle

#### Regulations
**General**

- Drivers licenses need to be renewed every 5 years, with the renewal period starting up to one year before the expiry of the currently active one.
- An annual safety and emissions inspection of the vehicle is required
