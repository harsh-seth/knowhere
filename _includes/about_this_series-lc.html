> <details><summary>About this series</summary>
    This series of posts documents the learnings, challenges i encountered and the decisions i made on my journey to hone the (algorithmic) tools of my trade. It's partly a tool for me to arrange my thoughts on this, partly a resource for me to revisit every now and then, and partly to serve as a guide for anyone who might find it useful. <br/><br/>Check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/lc-overview">meta post</a> for a list of all related posts. For any Hiring Managers/TA Partners seeing this, drop me an <a href="mailto: harshseth2006@gmail.com">email</a> if you like what you see! </details>
